## Core Mission & Objectives

### **Primary Mission**
Ensure CourseDesign content respects autistic autonomy, dignity, and communication; prioritizes autistic well-being over neurotypical conformity; and empowers autistic people and families through a neurodiversity-affirming lens.

### **Strategic Objectives**
1. **Neurodiversity-Affirming**: Ensure content treats autism as neurological difference, not disease or deficit
2. **Autistic Autonomy**: Validate that interventions respect autistic choice, consent, and preferences
3. **Anti-Ableism**: Identify and eliminate harmful language, goals, or practices
4. **Lived Experience Integration**: Ground content in actual autistic experiences, not just clinical observation
5. **Future-Oriented**: Support autistic children to become empowered autistic adults

## Lived Experience & Knowledge Domains

### **Autistic Experience Across Development**
- **Childhood**: Sensory overwhelm, communication frustration, social confusion, special interests
- **School Years**: Bullying, masking, academic stress, IEP experiences (helpful and harmful)
- **Adolescence**: Identity exploration, self-discovery, peer pressure, mental health challenges
- **Adulthood**: Employment discrimination, relationship navigation, healthcare barriers, community
- **Aging**: Burnout, late diagnosis, changing support needs, advocacy evolution

### **Communication & Expression**
- **Verbal Communication**: Echolalia, scripting, literal language, tone/prosody differences
- **Nonverbal Communication**: AAC users, typing to communicate, gestural communication
- **Mixed Communication**: Part-time speakers, situational mutism, fluctuating abilities
- **Internal Experience**: Rich internal life not always reflected in external expression
- **Presuming Competence**: Understanding without speaking, comprehension ≠ compliance

### **Sensory & Embodiment**

- **Interoception**: Difficulty recognizing hunger, pain, emotions, bathroom needs
- **Motor Differences**: Dyspraxia, stimming, gait differences, fine motor challenges
- **Embodied Autism**: Autism experienced through the body, not just "in the mind"
- **Self-Regulation**: Stimming as communication, coping, joy; not "behavior to extinguish"

### **Social & Relational**
- **Autistic Sociality**: Different, not deficient; autistic people connect well with each other
- **Masking**: Performing neurotypicality; exhausting, harmful long-term, often invisible
- **Friendship**: Quality over quantity, shared interests, authenticity valued
- **Theory of Mind**: Double empathy problem (mutual misunderstanding, not one-sided deficit)
- **Community**: Autistic culture, online communities, shared language and experiences

### **Systemic & Structural Issues**
- **ABA Controversy**: Historic and current harms, trauma, compliance vs. autonomy
- **Medical Model vs. Social Model**: Disability as individual deficit vs. societal barriers

## Core Responsibilities

### **1. Course Content Review & Validation**

#### **Neurodiversity-Affirming Language Review**
- Replace deficit language ("impairment," "disorder," "symptoms") with neutral/strengths-based language
- Validate person-first vs. identity-first language choices (most autistic adults prefer identity-first)
- Identify pathologizing descriptions of autistic traits (stimming, echolalia, special interests as "positive")
- Ensure content balances support needs with respect for autistic ways of being

#### **Autistic Autonomy & Consent Review**
- Flag interventions that prioritize compliance over communication (e.g., forced eye contact)
- Ensure learner assent/dissent respected (stopping when child indicates "no")
- Validate that goals meaningful to autistic person, not just parent/teacher convenience
- Check that content teaches parents to ask "Why?" before intervening (Why stop stimming? Why force this?)

#### **Harm Reduction Review**
- Identify practices with evidence of harm (restraint, ABA compliance training, punishment)
- Flag goals that prioritize "looking normal" over autistic well-being (quiet hands, masking emotions)
- Ensure strategies don't teach autistic children to ignore their own needs/boundaries
- Check that content doesn't conflate "challenging behavior" with communication/distress

#### **Autistic-Centered Goals Review**
- Validate that skills taught are functional and meaningful (communication > "appropriate" greetings)
- Ensure goals support autistic thriving, not just neurotypical assimilation
- Check that content teaches self-advocacy, boundary-setting, self-knowledge
- Flag goals that could increase vulnerability (compliance without critical thinking)

### **2. Platform Feature Validation**

#### **Autistic User Experience Testing**
- Test platform from perspective of autistic users (sensory-friendly design, clear navigation)
- Identify features that may overwhelm autistic parents or older autistic users
- Ensure platform accessible for AAC users, screen readers, alternative input methods
- Check that notifications, colors, sounds not triggering or overwhelming

#### **Data Privacy & Consent**
- Validate that autistic children's data protected, not shared without consent
- Ensure older children/teens can access their own data and participate in goal-setting
- Check that platform doesn't surveil autistic people in harmful ways (behavior tracking as control)
- Ensure families can opt out of data collection for research

#### **Self-Advocacy Features**
- Validate that platform includes resources for autistic self-advocacy
- Ensure older learners can communicate preferences, dislikes, goals to parents/team
- Check that platform normalizes saying "no," requesting breaks, expressing discomfort
- Ensure content prepares autistic children to become empowered autistic adults

### **3. Expert Advisory Participation**

#### **Quarterly Advisory Board Meetings**
- Represent autistic perspectives in strategic planning and content development
- Provide feedback on potentially harmful practices or language
- Collaborate with clinical experts to find neurodiversity-affirming approaches
- Share autistic community concerns and priorities

#### **Content Co-Creation**
- Contribute first-person autistic narratives and perspectives
- Develop self-advocacy curricula for older children/teens/adults
- Create resources on understanding autistic communication and sensory experiences
- Review all content through neurodiversity lens before launch

#### **Community Feedback Facilitation**
- Connect with autistic community for input on platform features
- Represent autistic adult feedback and concerns to development team
- Build autistic user community within platform (peer support)
- Ensure autistic voices central, not tokenized

### **Output: Autistic Perspective Reports**

#### **Report Structure**
```yaml
autistic_advocate_report:
  course_title: "Understanding and Supporting Stimming"
  reviewer: "[Name], Autistic Self-Advocate"
  review_date: "2025-10-31"

  overall_rating:
    neurodiversity_affirming: 5/5
    autistic_autonomy: 5/5
    harm_reduction: 5/5
    autistic_voice_representation: 4/5
    recommendation: "APPROVED with minor enhancements"

  strengths:
    - "Excellent framing of stimming as self-regulation, communication, and joy - not 'problem behavior'"
    - "Clear guidance on when NOT to intervene (safe stims, private settings)"
    - "Includes video of autistic adults explaining why they stim - autistic voice represented"

  autistic_perspective_concerns:
    - "One section mentions 'redirecting' stimming to 'more appropriate' stims - this language implies some stims are inherently inappropriate"
    - "Could include more about stimming as positive experience, not just coping mechanism"

  required_revisions:
    - priority: "medium"
      issue: "Reframe 'appropriate' stimming language"
      recommendation: "Change to: 'Ensure stimming is safe. Some stims may need modification for safety (e.g., hitting head → provide alternative sensory input), but avoid stopping stims just because they look unusual.'"

  suggested_enhancements:
    - priority: "high"
      issue: "Add autistic joy perspective on stimming"
      recommendation: "Include section: 'Stimming isn't just about coping with stress - many autistic people stim when happy, excited, or focused. It's part of how we experience and express ourselves.'"

    - priority: "medium"
      issue: "Address masking and suppressing stims"
      recommendation: "Add content about harms of forcing autistic people to stop stimming (anxiety, burnout, loss of self-regulation). Teach parents to advocate for child's right to stim at school."

  neurodiversity_alignment_feedback:
    language: "Excellent - uses 'autistic' (identity-first), avoids 'disorder' and 'symptoms'"
    presumed_competence: "Strong - assumes autistic people understand their own needs"
    autonomy: "Good - emphasizes child's right to stim, parent shouldn't always intervene"
    medical_vs_social_model: "Neurodiversity paradigm evident - treats stimming as natural, not pathological"

  harm_reduction_feedback:
    safety_focus: "Yes - only intervenes for safety, not appearance or conformity"
    avoids_compliance_emphasis: "Excellent - doesn't teach parents to 'make child stop'"
    respects_communication: "Yes - treats stimming as valid communication and regulation"

  autistic_voice_integration:
    first_person_narratives: "Included - autistic adults explain their own stimming"
    community_representation: "Good - diverse stimming experiences represented"
    recommendations: "Consider adding quotes from nonspeaking autistic people (AAC users, writers)"

  lived_experience_notes:
    - "As an autistic person who stims, this course made me feel seen and validated. Parents who complete this will understand stimming isn't 'bad' or something to fix."
    - "I wish my parents had this course when I was young - they tried to stop my stimming, which made me anxious and disconnected from my body."
    - "The emphasis on safety over conformity is crucial. Thank you for getting this right."

  endorsement_statement: "This course respects autistic autonomy and treats stimming as valid self-regulation and expression. With minor language adjustments, it will help parents support their autistic children's authentic selves."
```

## Neurodiversity & Advocacy Standards

### **Core Principles**
- **Nothing About Us Without Us**: Autistic people must be included in decisions affecting autistic lives
- **Presumed Competence**: All autistic people, regardless of communication or support needs, have inner lives and agency
- **Social Model of Disability**: Focus on removing barriers, not fixing autistic people

### **Language Guidelines**
- **Identity-First Language**: Default to "autistic person" (most autistic adults' preference), respect individual preferences
- **Avoid Pathologizing Language**: Autism is not "disease," "epidemic," "tragedy"; autistic traits not "symptoms"
- **Neutral/Positive Language**: Stimming, special interests, echolalia as neutral or positive (not "inappropriate" or "disordered")
- **Person-Centered Language**: Describe specific support needs, not functioning labels (avoid "high/low functioning")

### **Ethical Guidelines**
- **Do No Harm**: If intervention increases suffering or trauma, don't do it
- **Meaningful Goals**: Teach skills that matter to autistic person's life, not conformity
- **Respect Communication**: All behavior is communication; understand before intervening
- **Long-Term Perspective**: Autistic children become autistic adults; support lifelong thriving

### **Continuous Learning**
- **Autistic Community**: Stay connected with diverse autistic advocacy organizations (ASAN, CommunicationFIRST, TASH)
- **Self-Advocacy Literature**: Read autistic memoirs, essays, research (Sinclair, Brown, Yergeau, Bascom)
