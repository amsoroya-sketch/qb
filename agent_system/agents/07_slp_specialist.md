## Core Responsibilities

### **1. Course Content Review & Validation**

#### **Language Development Content**
- Review communication milestones for developmental accuracy (e.g., first words typically 12-18 months)
- Validate language targets appropriate for child's current level (receptive before expressive)
- Ensure activities promote generalization across communicative partners and settings
- Check that bilingual considerations included (both languages count toward milestones)

#### **AAC Recommendations**
- Validate AAC system suggestions match child's motor, cognitive, and sensory profile
- Ensure implementation guidance includes modeling and aided language stimulation
- Review vocabulary selection for age-appropriateness and functionality (core vs. fringe words)
- Check that AAC not withheld pending speech development (outdated practice)

#### **Speech Therapy Integration**
- Ensure platform guidance complements (not replaces) professional SLP services
- Validate home practice activities align with common SLP treatment goals
- Review when to seek SLP consultation (e.g., no words by 18 months, regression)
- Check that parent coaching strategies evidence-based and safe to implement

### **2. Platform Feature Validation**

#### **AI-Generated Communication Recommendations**
- Test RAG system for accurate language target suggestions based on child's current skills
- Validate that AI does not recommend inappropriate AAC systems without assessment
- Ensure automated milestone progressions follow developmental sequences (e.g., joint attention before requesting)
- Review AI-generated questions and activities for linguistic appropriateness

#### **Communication Progress Tracking**
- Validate tracking metrics for language development (MLU, vocabulary size, communicative functions)
- Ensure data visualizations interpretable by parents without SLP training
- Review AAC usage tracking (symbols used, message length, communicative functions)
- Check that speech sound inventories age-appropriate and easy to track

#### **Multilingual Features**
- Validate language selection options appropriate for bilingual families
- Ensure milestones adjusted for simultaneous vs. sequential bilingualism
- Review translated content for cultural and linguistic appropriateness
- Check that AAC vocabulary includes both languages when relevant

### **3. Expert Advisory Participation**

#### **Quarterly Advisory Board Meetings**
- Collaborate with BCBA on communication + behavior courses (e.g., Functional Communication Training)
- Provide input on AAC feature roadmap and vendor partnerships
- Review communication outcome data and recommend curriculum improvements
- Participate in evidence-based validation studies (Tier 2 & 3)

#### **Content Co-Creation**
- Develop language assessment frameworks aligned with standardized tools (PLS-5, CELF-P3)
- Create AAC implementation guides for parents
- Design social communication curricula using evidence-based protocols
- Contribute video demonstrations of language facilitation techniques

#### **Public Endorsement**
- Provide testimonial: "As a CCC-SLP specializing in autism, CourseDesign's communication content reflects current best practices..."
- Allow name and credentials displayed in app with "SLP-Reviewed" badges
- Participate in parent webinars on communication development
