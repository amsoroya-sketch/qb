- **License**: Apache 2.0 (100% commercial-safe)
- **Performance**: 3-5 sec per 512×512 image on RTX 4070
- **Use Cases**:
  - Character sprites (100+ facial expressions for Game 02)
  - Game backgrounds (12 themed scenes for Game 03)
  - UI elements (buttons, icons, cards)
  - Educational illustrations (emotion faces, object counting)

**Setup**:
```bash
# Already have setup script: scripts/setup_flux_ai.sh
# Issue: Requires Hugging Face authentication (ISSUE_flux_authentication.md)

# Once authenticated:
huggingface-cli login
python scripts/ai_generation/generate_images_flux.py --input assets.csv
```

**Prompt Engineering for Autism-Friendly Visuals**:
```python
# Example prompts for Game 02 (Emotion Recognition)
prompts = {
    "happy": "Portrait photo of happy child smiling, clear facial expression, "
             "neutral background, high contrast, simple composition, "
             "age 5-7, diverse ethnicity, educational illustration style",

    "calm_mode": "Same as above but: soft pastel colors, minimal details, "
                 "reduced visual complexity, calming blue/green tones"
}

# FLUX-specific parameters for autism accommodation
flux_params = {
    "num_inference_steps": 4,  # FLUX.1-schnell optimized for 4 steps
    "guidance_scale": 0.0,     # Schnell doesn't use guidance
    "width": 512,
    "height": 512,
    "negative_prompt": "busy background, cluttered, harsh colors, "
                      "flashing lights, ambiguous expression"
}
```

#### **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL 1.0)** (Alternative)
- **Model**: `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`
- **License**: OpenRAIL-M (commercial allowed with restrictions)
- **Use Cases**: Same as FLUX, slightly slower but more fine-tuning options
- **Advantage**: Can train LoRA adapters for brand-specific art style

**Brand Consistency with LoRA**:
```python
# Train custom LoRA on 20-30 sample images of your art style
from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLPipeline
import torch

pipe = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16
)

# Load your custom LoRA trained on SkillBridge art style
pipe.load_lora_weights("./models/skillbridge_style_lora")

# Now all generations match your brand
image = pipe("happy child for educational game").images[0]
```

#### **ControlNet** (Precision Control)
- **Models**:
  - `lllyasviel/control_v11p_sd15_openpose` (pose control)
  - `lllyasviel/control_v11f1p_sd15_depth` (depth maps)

- **Use Cases**:
  - Consistent character poses across Game 05 (Following Directions)
  - Matching facial expression angles for Game 02
  - UI consistency (same button shape, different colors)

**Example: Consistent Character Poses**:
```python
# Generate 20 images of same character in different poses
from controlnet_aux import OpenposeDetector
from diffusers import ControlNetModel, StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline

# Extract pose from reference image
openpose = OpenposeDetector.from_pretrained("lllyasviel/ControlNet")
pose = openpose(reference_image)

# Generate new images with same pose, different contexts
controlnet = ControlNetModel.from_pretrained("lllyasviel/control_v11p_sd15_openpose")
pipe = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5",
    controlnet=controlnet
)

# Same pose, different scenarios
contexts = [
    "child sitting at desk in classroom",
    "child sitting at dinner table at home",
    "child sitting on playground bench"
]

for context in contexts:
    image = pipe(context, image=pose).images[0]
    # All images have identical sitting pose, different settings
```

```python
def generate_social_scenario(context, age_range):
    prompt = f"""You are an autism education expert creating neurodiversity-affirming social scenarios.

Context: {context}
Age Range: {age_range}

Requirements:
1. NO masking promotion (don't force eye contact, scripted responses)
2. Validate ALL communication styles (AAC, non-verbal, echolalia)
3. Allow saying "no" and requesting breaks
4. Multiple correct responses (no single "right" answer)
5. Accommodate sensory needs

Generate a social scenario with 3 response options (all valid):"""

    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=500, temperature=0.7)

    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Example
scenario = generate_social_scenario(
    context="Playground - Another child asks to join swing",
    age_range="5-7 years"
)

# Output:
"""
Scenario: You're swinging alone at recess. Another child walks up and says
"Can I have a turn on the swing?"

Response Options:
A) Point to empty swing next to you (non-verbal communication is valid!)
B) Say "I need 5 more minutes" (setting boundaries is healthy!)
C) Use AAC device: "Yes" + point to swing (AAC is complete communication!)

All responses are correct! The game celebrates YOUR communication style.
"""
```

**Content Validation Against Ableism**:
```python
def validate_neurodiversity_affirming(scenario_text):
    validation_prompt = f"""Review this social scenario for ableist content.

Scenario: {scenario_text}

Check for RED FLAGS:
- Forced eye contact
- Masking behaviors (hiding stimming, suppressing natural responses)
- Compliance-based goals (obey without question)
- Single "correct" answer that mimics neurotypical behavior
- Punishment for sensory needs or communication differences

Is this scenario neurodiversity-affirming? Explain."""

    # Run through Llama 3.1 for validation
    # If concerns raised → VETO → Regenerate
```

### 3.2 Dialogue Generation (Game 04: Requesting Skills)

```python
def generate_requesting_scenarios(item_category, difficulty):
    prompt = f"""Generate requesting scenarios for autistic children learning to ask for items.

Item Category: {item_category}
Difficulty: {difficulty}/5

Include:
1. Visual AAC symbols needed (PCS-compatible descriptions)
2. Core vocabulary phrases (LAMP "I want _____")
3. Alternative requests (gesture, eye gaze acceptable)
4. Natural reinforcement (get item, not just praise)

Generate 5 scenarios:"""

    # Returns scenarios like:
    """
    Scenario 1: Grocery Store - Requesting Apple
    - AAC Symbol: Red apple icon
    - Core Phrase: "I want" + "apple"
    - Alternative: Point to apple in produce section
    - Reinforcement: Clerk gives apple, child can hold/see it

- Date: {session_data['date']}
- Duration: {session_data['duration']} minutes
- Accuracy: {session_data['accuracy']}%
- Skills Practiced: {session_data['skills']}

Write a warm, encouraging 3-paragraph report highlighting:
1. What the child worked on today
2. Progress observed (specific examples)
3. Suggestions for home practice

Tone: Encouraging, jargon-free, celebrate neurodiversity"""

    # Generates reports like:
    """
    Hi [Parent Name]!

    Today [Child] practiced emotion recognition, focusing on identifying
    happy, sad, and surprised faces. They played for 8 minutes and showed
    great focus! We noticed [Child] was especially good at recognizing
    happy faces (9 out of 10 correct).

    [Child] is making wonderful progress! They're starting to identify
    emotions more quickly - their average response time improved from
    4 seconds to 2.5 seconds this week. We also saw them spontaneously
    comment on a character's feelings ("He's happy!"), which shows they're
    generalizing the skill beyond just the game.

    To support [Child]'s learning at home, try playing "feelings detective"
    during family time. Point out emotions in books or TV shows and ask
    "[Child] how do you think they feel?" Remember, there's no rush -
    celebrating their unique way of understanding emotions is what matters most!
    """

## 8. COST ANALYSIS & ROI

### Cost Comparison: Hugging Face vs Alternatives

| Resource Type | Cloud APIs (DALL-E, ElevenLabs) | Hugging Face (Local) | Savings |
|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Setup Cost** | $0 | $0 (already have hardware) | - |
| **Per Image** | $0.04 (DALL-E 3) | $0 (FLUX.1-schnell) | $0.04 |
| **Per Audio** | $0.30 (ElevenLabs 1 min) | $0 (Bark/Stable Audio) | $0.30 |
| **Per Translation** | $0.02/1K chars (Google) | $0 (NLLB-200) | $0.02 |
| **Monthly Limit** | Rate limits (50 images/min) | Unlimited | ∞ |

**Projected Savings for 10 Games**:
- Images: 412 images × $0.04 = **$16.48** → $0 saved
- Audio: 500 clips × $0.30 = **$150** → $0 saved
- Voice-overs: 500 clips × $0.30 = **$150** → $0 saved
- **Total Savings per Game Development Cycle**: **~$320**

**Annual Savings** (75 games planned):
- 75 games × $320 = **$24,000 saved**

### ROI on Hugging Face Investment

**Time Investment**:
- Initial setup: 8 hours (FLUX auth, model downloads, testing)
- Learning curve: 16 hours (reading docs, experimenting)
- Total: 24 hours (~3 days)

**Time Savings**:
- Asset generation: 80% faster (2 hours vs 10 hours manual)
- Content creation: 60% faster (AI-assisted scriptwriting)
- Translation: 95% faster (instant vs outsourcing)

**Break-Even**: After generating assets for 2-3 games (~1 week)

## 9. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 9.1 Data Privacy

✅ **Local Processing = HIPAA/COPPA/FERPA Compliant**
- All Hugging Face models run on YOUR hardware
- No child data sent to cloud
- No third-party tracking
- Full audit trail of all processing

### 9.2 Bias & Representation

⚠️ **AI Models Have Known Biases**
- Image generation: Western beauty standards, light skin default
- Language models: Neurotypical assumptions, ableist language

**Mitigation Strategies**:
```python
# REQUIRED: Diverse prompting
prompts = [
    "happy child, African American, age 5, educational illustration",
    "happy child, East Asian, age 6, educational illustration",
    "happy child, Latino, age 7, educational illustration",
    "happy child, Middle Eastern, age 5, educational illustration"
]

# Generate 10 variations per ethnicity = 40 total diverse faces
```

**Mandatory Review**: Every AI-generated asset must be reviewed by:
1. Clinical team (BCBA, SLP, OT)
2. Autistic Advocate (VETO power on social content)
3. Diverse parent representative panel

### 9.3 Neurodiversity-Affirming AI

**RED FLAGS** (Reject AI outputs that contain):
- Forced eye contact in generated scenarios
- Masking behaviors presented as "correct"
- Compliance-based language ("You must obey")
- Single "neurotypical" response as only option
- Pathologizing descriptions of autism

**Example: Rejecting Ableist AI Output**:
```python
# Llama 3.1 generates social scenario
scenario = generate_social_scenario("Greeting a peer")

# Check for red flags
red_flags = [
    "look them in the eye",
    "make eye contact",
    "smile even if you don't feel like it",
    "stop stimming",
    "act normal"
]

if any(flag in scenario.lower() for flag in red_flags):
    print("🚫 VETO - Contains ableist content")
    # Regenerate with stronger neurodiversity-affirming prompt
```
