## 1. GAME OVERVIEW

### Game Title
**Social Scenarios: Playground Adventures**

### High-Level Concept
An interactive multiplayer social skills game where children learn pragmatic language, turn-taking, perspective-taking, and conversational skills through engaging real-world scenarios. Players navigate social situations (playground, birthday party, classroom) making choices about appropriate responses, practicing cooperation, and developing Theory of Mind. Optional multiplayer mode enables sibling/peer collaboration and authentic social interaction practice.

### Target Audience

- **Difficulty Level**: 4-6 (Emerging to fluent communicator)
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Basic receptive language (follows 2-3 step directions)
  - Pointing or AAC selection capability
  - Attention span of 8-10 minutes
  - Completed basic turn-taking activities (or equivalent)

### Core Learning Objectives

**Primary Skills** (ABLLS-R I-Series - Social Interaction):
- **I1-I2**: Initiates social interaction (greeting, waving, approaching peer)
- **I3-I4**: Responds to social bids (answering questions, responding to name)
- **I5-I6**: Turn-taking in activities (waits for turn, takes turns without prompting)
- **I7-I8**: Shares materials/toys with others (offers, accepts offers)
- **I9-I10**: Engages in cooperative play (plays alongside peers, joint activities)
- **I11-I12**: Maintains conversational exchanges (2-3 back-and-forth turns)
- **I13-I14**: Asks for help appropriately (uses words/AAC, waits for response)
- **I15**: Shows empathy/concern for others' feelings

**Secondary Skills** (VB-MAPP & Pragmatic Language):
- **VB-MAPP 9L**: Conversational skills (topic maintenance, conversational repair)
- **VB-MAPP 10L**: Intraverbal responses in social contexts
- **Pragmatic Language**: Greetings, farewells, commenting, requesting, refusing politely
- **Theory of Mind**: Understanding others' perspectives, emotions, intentions

**Social-Emotional Competencies**:
- Perspective-taking ("How does my friend feel?")
- Conflict resolution (negotiating, compromising)
- Friendship skills (complimenting, showing interest)
- Self-advocacy (stating preferences without aggression)
- Reading social cues (facial expressions, body language, tone)

### Game Duration
- **Per Session**: 12-15 minutes
- **Per Scenario**: 3-5 minutes
- **Total Scenarios**: 20+ (5 contexts × 4+ situations each)
- **Multiplayer Sessions**: 15-20 minutes (includes co-op mode)
- **Estimated Mastery Time**: 6-8 weeks (3-4 sessions/week)

### Critical Design Philosophy: Neurodiversity-Affirming
⚠️ **MANDATORY AUTISTIC ADVOCATE REVIEW** - This game addresses social skills, historically a problematic area in ABA where forcing "neurotypical social compliance" has caused trauma. Our approach:

1. **NO MASKING PROMOTION**: We teach functional communication, NOT forcing eye contact, suppressing stimming, or "acting normal"
2. **AUTONOMY-FIRST**: Children learn to CHOOSE social engagement, not be coerced into it
3. **AUTHENTIC INTERACTION**: Scenarios reflect genuine autistic experiences, not forced neurotypical expectations
4. **SENSORY CONSIDERATIONS**: No punishment for needing breaks, using different communication styles, or sensory accommodations
5. **PEER ACCEPTANCE**: Scenarios include neurotypical peers learning to accept autistic communication styles (bidirectional!)

**Autistic Advocate has VETO POWER** over any scenario content that violates these principles.

## 2. CLINICAL FRAMEWORK

### ABLLS-R I-Series Alignment (Social Interaction)

| ABLLS-R Code | Skill Description | Game Implementation | Target Mastery |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **I1** | Initiates interaction (approaches peer) | "Wave to friend" prompt, approach avatar on playground | 80% across 3 scenarios |
| **I2** | Initiates verbal interaction (greeting) | "Say hi to [name]" - AAC/voice greeting options | 80% across 5 trials |
| **I3** | Responds to name/social bid | Friend calls player's name, must acknowledge | 85% response rate |
| **I4** | Responds to questions (answers appropriately) | "What's your favorite color?" - selection responses | 80% appropriate answers |
| **I5** | Waits for turn (inhibits impulsive action) | Turn-taking mini-games, visual wait cues | 75% successful waiting |
| **I6** | Takes turns without prompting | Playground equipment rotation, game turns | 80% independent turn-taking |
| **I7** | Offers to share (prosocial behavior) | "Share toy with friend?" choice prompts | 70% sharing offers |
| **I8** | Accepts offers from peers | Friend offers toy/snack, must accept gracefully | 85% acceptance |

| **I15** | Shows concern for peer's feelings | "Friend is sad" scenario, comfort/empathy responses | 70% empathetic responses |

**Baseline Assessment Protocol**:
- Pre-game: Parent/therapist completes I-series checklist (current functioning)
- Placement algorithm:
  - I1-I5 mastered (70%+) → Start Scenario Set 2
  - I1-I10 mastered → Start Scenario Set 3
  - I1-I15 mastered → Advanced scenarios (perspective-taking)

### VB-MAPP Milestones (Social Communication)

**Level 2 (18-30 months developmental)**:
- **Social 1**: Spontaneously interacts with others (mands, tacts, points)
- **Social 2**: Responds to presence of others (joint attention, gaze shifts)

**Level 3 (30-48 months developmental)**:
- **Social 3**: Plays with peers (parallel → associative play)
- **Social 4**: Responds to peer social bids (75% of opportunities)

**Advanced Milestones (Ages 5+)**:
- **Intraverbal 9L**: Conversational turn-taking (3-5 exchanges)
- **Intraverbal 10L**: Topic maintenance (stays on topic 80%+)
- **Social 5**: Initiates social play with peers independently

### Teaching Methodology (Evidence-Based Practices)

**1. Natural Environment Teaching (NET)**
```
Scenario: Playground slide
Natural SD: "It's your turn on the slide!"
Child Response: Climbs slide, waits at top
Natural Consequence: Slides down, experiences fun, friend cheers
Social Reinforcement: Peer says "Great job waiting!"
```

**2. Video Modeling + Interactive Practice**
- Watch 10-second video of target skill (e.g., greeting peer)
- Immediately practice in game scenario (transfer of stimulus control)
- Receive immediate feedback (correct/try again)
- Review video again if errors persist

**3. Choice-Making Framework (Autonomy)**
```
Scenario: Friend asks to play tag
Options provided:
  A) "Yes! Let's play!" (socially engaged)
  B) "No thanks, I want to swing" (assertive, honest)
  C) "Maybe later" (compromise)
  D) Non-verbal (wave, sign, AAC symbol)

NO OPTION IS "WRONG" - Game validates all communication:
- Option A: "Great! You're playing together!"
- Option B: "You used your words! Friend understands."
- Option C: "Good compromise! Friend waits with you."
- Option D: "You communicated! Friend sees your sign."
```

**4. Perspective-Taking Training (Theory of Mind)**
- **Perception**: "What does friend see from their spot?"
- **Emotion**: "How does friend feel? Look at their face."
- **Desire**: "What does friend want? They said they're hungry."
- **Belief**: "What does friend think? They don't know toy is broken."

**5. Errorless Learning for Anxiety Reduction**
- High-anxiety scenarios (e.g., "Friend is crying") start with:
  - Visual cue: Thought bubble shows "I can help!"
  - Gestural prompt: Hand icon points to "Hug" or "Ask if OK" button
  - Verbal prompt: "Your friend is sad. What can you do?"
- Prompts fade as confidence builds

**6. Data Collection (Per Scenario)**
```json
{
  "scenario_id": "SOC-PLAYGROUND-001",
  "ABLLS_R_skills": ["I5", "I6", "I10"],
  "target_behavior": "turn_taking_on_swing",

  "trial_id": "SOC-2025-001-0089"
}
```

### SLP Clinical Input (Pragmatic Language Focus)

**Pragmatic Language Targets** (Age-Appropriate):

**Tier 1 (Ages 5-6)**: Basic Social Communication
- Greetings: "Hi!", "Bye!", waving
- Requests: "Can I play?", "My turn please"
- Comments: "That's cool!", "I like your toy"
- Refusing: "No thank you", shaking head
- Simple questions: "What's that?", "Where's [item]?"

**Tier 2 (Ages 7-8)**: Conversational Skills
- Topic initiation: "Do you like dinosaurs?"
- Topic maintenance: Asking follow-up questions
- Conversational repair: "What did you say?" when confused
- Polite interrupting: "Excuse me..."
- Complimenting: "You're good at that!"

**Tier 3 (Ages 9-10)**: Advanced Pragmatics
- Perspective-taking: "I think you like blue because..."
- Negotiation: "How about we take turns?"
- Conflict resolution: "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..."
- Sarcasm detection: Recognizing tone differences (with warnings for literality)
- Social problem-solving: "What could we do instead?"

**AAC Integration Requirements**:
- Core social vocabulary boards (greeting, feelings, actions, locations)
- Pre-programmed social scripts ("Want to play?" button)
- Custom message creation (combine symbols: "I" + "want" + "swing")
- Voice output synchronized with game events
- Symbol highlighting during peer speech (visual support)
- PECS-style exchange animations (for exchange-based learners)

**Prosody & Non-Verbal Communication**:
- Facial expression recognition (happy, sad, angry, confused, excited)
- Body language interpretation (arms crossed = maybe upset, leaning in = interested)
- Tone of voice cues (excited vs. calm vs. frustrated - auditory learners)
- Personal space concepts (proximity indicators, "too close" visual feedback)

## 8. ACCESSIBILITY & ACCOMMODATIONS

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

**Perceivable**:
- ✅ **1.1.1 Non-text Content**: All character avatars, environments, icons have descriptive alt text
- ✅ **1.4.3 Contrast**: Response button text 4.5:1 contrast, peer dialogue bubbles 4.5:1
- ✅ **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast**: UI elements (turn indicator, skill tracker) 3:1 contrast
- ✅ **1.4.13 Content on Hover**: Dialogue bubbles persist, not dismissed by mouse movement

**Operable**:
- ✅ **2.1.1 Keyboard**: Full keyboard navigation (Tab, arrow keys, Enter, number keys)
- ✅ **2.2.1 Timing Adjustable**: Response time limit adjustable 10-60 seconds or unlimited
- ✅ **2.4.7 Focus Visible**: Clear focus indicator on response buttons (3px blue border)
- ✅ **2.5.5 Target Size**: Response buttons 200×80px minimum (44px height exceeds WCAG)

**Understandable**:
- ✅ **3.1.1 Language of Page**: HTML lang="en", AAC symbols language-neutral
- ✅ **3.2.1 On Focus**: No automatic scenario changes when UI receives focus
- ✅ **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions**: All response choices clearly labeled with text + icons

**Robust**:
- ✅ **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- ✅ **4.1.3 Status Messages**: aria-live regions announce scenario changes, feedback

### Autism-Specific Accommodations

**Sensory Sensitivities**:
1. **Visual Overload Reduction**:
   - Calm mode: Simple backgrounds (solid colors), reduced character animation
   - No flashing lights or rapid movements
   - Predictable UI placement (response buttons always in same location)

2. **Auditory Sensitivities**:
   - Volume controls: Separate sliders for narrator, peers, environment, effects
   - Voice pitch adjustment: ±20% (some children prefer higher/lower voices)
   - No sudden loud sounds (all audio normalized, gradual fades)

3. **Motion Sensitivity**:
   - Reduced motion mode: Disable character walk animations, instant transitions
   - Camera fixed (no panning, zooming)

**Executive Function Support**:
- Visual schedule: "Scenario 1 of 4 complete" progress indicator
- Scenario preview: "Next: Birthday Party!" with thumbnail
- Pause button accessible anytime (large button, always visible)
- "Take a Break" option: Breathing exercise mini-game (calm space)

**Communication Support**:
- AAC integration: Import child's personal core vocabulary
- Pre-programmed scripts: "I need a break" button always available
- Processing time: Adjustable response time limits (10-60+ seconds)
- No forced speech: Non-verbal responses always valid

**Anxiety Reduction**:
- No surprise scenarios (preview shown before starting)
- Low-stakes gameplay (no punishment for "wrong" answers)
- Familiar characters (same peer avatars across scenarios)
- Escape available: Can exit scenario without penalty

## 9. TESTING & VALIDATION

### Clinical Validation Protocol

**Phase 1: BCBA Review** (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Verify ABLLS-R I-series skill mappings (I1-I15)
- [ ] Review prompting hierarchy (errorless → independent)
- [ ] Approve reinforcement schedule (social + token)
- [ ] Confirm data collection captures meaningful metrics
- [ ] Validate turn-taking mini-games align with NET principles
- **Sign-off Required**: BCBA-001

**Phase 2: SLP Review** (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Verify pragmatic language targets (greetings, requests, conversation)
- [ ] Approve AAC symbol integration and core vocabulary
- [ ] Confirm voice-over scripts use child-friendly language
- [ ] Review conversational repair strategies
- [ ] Validate topic maintenance mechanics
- **Sign-off Required**: SLP-001

**Phase 3: Autistic Advocate Review** (Day 3-5) ⚠️ CRITICAL
- [ ] **VETO POWER**: Ensure NO masking promotion in any scenario
- [ ] Verify scenarios respect autonomy (saying "no" is valid)
- [ ] Confirm no forced eye contact requirements
- [ ] Check peer characters include openly autistic representation
- [ ] Validate sensory accommodations (pause, calm mode)
- [ ] Ensure self-advocacy options available ("I need space", "Too loud")
- [ ] Confirm neurodiversity-affirming language throughout
- **Sign-off Required**: ADVOCATE-001 (MANDATORY - CAN VETO)

**Phase 4: Child Psychologist Review** (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Review Theory of Mind scenarios (developmentally appropriate)
- [ ] Validate emotion recognition accuracy
- [ ] Confirm no traumatic or anxiety-inducing scenarios
- [ ] Approve perspective-taking mechanics
- **Sign-off Required**: PSYCH-001

**Phase 5: Parent Testing** (Day 10-15)
- [ ] Test with 5 beta families (children ages 5-10)
- [ ] Collect usability feedback
- [ ] Measure engagement (>10 min sustained attention)
- [ ] Verify real-world generalization (skills used outside game)
- [ ] Multiplayer testing (3 families with siblings)
- **Threshold**: 4/5 families report positive experience

### Autistic Advocate Veto Examples

**SCENARIO THAT WOULD BE VETOED**:
```
❌ REJECTED SCENARIO:
Prompt: "Look your friend in the eyes when they talk to you."
Choices: "Make eye contact", "Look away" (marked as incorrect)

VETO REASON: Forces eye contact, a common traumatic demand in ABA.
Autistic people often cannot process information and make eye contact
simultaneously. This promotes masking.

CORRECTED SCENARIO:
Prompt: "Your friend is talking to you! Show you're listening."
Choices:
  - "Look at friend's face" (appropriate)
  - "Nod your head" (appropriate)
  - "Say 'uh-huh'" (appropriate)
  - "Look at their shoes" (appropriate - parallel attention!)
All choices valid - different ways to show attention!
```

**ANOTHER VETO EXAMPLE**:
```
❌ REJECTED SCENARIO:
Prompt: "Stop flapping your hands. Friends might think it's weird."
Choices: "Stop flapping", "Put hands in pockets"

VETO REASON: Stigmatizes stimming, promotes masking to avoid judgment.
Autistic self-regulation should be supported, not suppressed.

CORRECTED SCENARIO:
Prompt: "You're excited about the swings! How do you feel?"
Choices:
  - "Jump up and down!" (stimming as celebration)
  - "Flap your hands!" (stimming)
  - "Say 'I'm excited!'" (verbal)
  - "Smile and run to swings" (action)
All choices valid - authentic emotional expression!
```

### Unit Tests

```csharp
[Test]
public void TestScenarioResponse_Appropriate()
{
    // Arrange
    SocialScenariosManager manager = new SocialScenariosManager();
    ScenarioData scenario = ScenarioDatabase.GetScenario("playground_greeting_01");
    ResponseOption response = scenario.responseOptions[0]; // "Yes! Let's swing!"

    // Act
    manager.EvaluateResponse(response, latency: 3.5f);

    // Assert
    Assert.IsTrue(response.appropriatenessLevel == AppropriatenessLevel.Ideal);
    Assert.AreEqual(15, PlayerDataManager.Instance.SocialPoints);
}

[Test]
public void TestTurnTaking_Success()
{
    // Arrange
    TurnTakingMiniGame miniGame = new TurnTakingMiniGame();

    // Act: Player waits during peer's turn
    bool playerWaited = miniGame.SimulateWaiting(duration: 3.0f, impulsiveActions: 0);

    // Assert
    Assert.IsTrue(playerWaited);
    Assert.AreEqual(1, SkillProgressManager.Instance.GetSuccessCount("I5_Waiting"));
}

[Test]
public void TestMultiplayer_Sync()
{
    // Arrange
    MultiplayerManager mp = new MultiplayerManager();
    mp.ConnectToMultiplayer();
    mp.CreateRoom("TestRoom123");

    // Act: Player 1 makes choice, syncs to Player 2
    mp.SendResponseChoice(responseIndex: 1);

    // Assert
    // (This would require mocking Photon networking)
    Assert.IsTrue(mp.IsConnected);
}

[Test]
public void TestAutismAccommodation_ProcessingTime()
{
    // Arrange
    SettingsManager.Instance.ResponseTimeLimit = 30f; // 30 seconds
    SocialScenariosManager manager = new SocialScenariosManager();

    // Act: Scenario presents with 30-second limit
    manager.LoadScenario();
    float actualTimeLimit = manager.GetCurrentTimeLimit();

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(30f, actualTimeLimit);
}
```

## 12. CONCLUSION

### Summary
**Social Scenarios: Playground Adventures** is a neurodiversity-affirming multiplayer social skills game that teaches pragmatic language, turn-taking, cooperation, and perspective-taking through authentic, autonomy-respecting scenarios. Aligned with ABLLS-R I-series (Social Interaction) skills, this game provides systematic social skill development while honoring autistic communication styles and eliminating coercive "neurotypical compliance" demands.

### Key Innovations
1. **Neurodiversity-First Design**: NO masking, NO forced eye contact, NO compliance-based goals
2. **Autistic Advocate Veto Power**: Ensures content is affirming, not traumatizing
3. **Multiplayer Co-Op Mode**: Authentic peer interaction practice with siblings/approved peers
4. **Choice-Affirming Feedback**: Saying "no" or choosing alternative responses is VALID
5. **Theory of Mind Training**: Perspective-taking without forcing conformity
6. **AAC-First Communication**: Non-verbal children fully supported throughout

### Clinical Impact
- **Target**: 70% of children improve ABLLS-R I-series skills by 2+ skills within 6 weeks
- **Data-Driven**: Every response tracked, social skill progress visible to parents/therapists
- **Generalization Focus**: Real-world scenarios bridge game → playground → home → school
- **Evidence-Based**: Built on NET (Natural Environment Teaching), not discrete trial drilling

### Ethical Safeguards
- **Mandatory Autistic Advocate Review**: Prevents ableist content from reaching children
- **Autonomy Respected**: No punishment for choosing non-engagement
- **Sensory Accommodations**: Calm mode, adjustable timers, always-available breaks
- **Representation Matters**: Openly autistic peer characters, diverse communication styles

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: BCBA/SLP/Autistic Advocate/Psychologist review of this GDD
2. **Week 1**: Begin asset generation (character avatars, environments)
3. **Week 2-3**: Unity development + multiplayer networking
4. **Week 4**: Accessibility audit + Autistic Advocate playtesting
5. **Week 5**: Beta testing with 5 families

**Document Status**: ✅ Complete, Ready for Clinical Review
**Estimated Development Cost**: $18,000-25,000 (25 days × team rates)
**Expected ROI**: Very High (social skills are critical for 100% of autistic children, often most requested by parents)

**⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER FOR DEVELOPMENT TEAM**:

This game addresses SOCIAL SKILLS - historically the most traumatizing area of ABA intervention due to forced masking and neurotypical compliance demands. We MUST get this right.

**Autistic Advocate approval is NON-NEGOTIABLE.**

If ANY scenario promotes masking, forces eye contact, punishes stimming, or demands neurotypical behavior, the Autistic Advocate WILL veto it, and we MUST revise.

Our goal: Teach FUNCTIONAL social communication that SERVES the autistic child, not force them to pretend to be neurotypical.

**Success = Autistic children communicate effectively in THEIR authentic way, not in a forced neurotypical mask.**
