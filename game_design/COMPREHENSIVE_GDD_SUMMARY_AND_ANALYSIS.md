## NEURODIVERSITY-AFFIRMING DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Design Philosophy (Critical for Social Skills Games)

**Game 07 (Social Scenarios) - MANDATORY AUTISTIC ADVOCATE REVIEW**:

⚠️ **AUTISTIC ADVOCATE HAS VETO POWER**

**Principles**:
1. **NO Masking Promotion**: Never force eye contact, suppress stimming, or demand "acting normal"
2. **Autonomy-First**: Children CHOOSE social engagement (saying "no" is VALID)
3. **Authentic Interaction**: Scenarios reflect genuine autistic experiences, not forced neurotypical expectations
4. **Sensory Considerations**: No punishment for needing breaks, using AAC, or sensory accommodations
5. **Peer Acceptance**: Scenarios include neurotypical peers learning to accept autistic communication (bidirectional!)

**Veto Examples**:
- ❌ **VETOED**: "Look your friend in the eyes when they talk to you"
  - **Reason**: Forces eye contact (traumatic ABA demand)
  - ✅ **Corrected**: "Show you're listening" (nod, say "uh-huh", look at shoes ALL valid)

- ❌ **VETOED**: "Stop flapping your hands. Friends might think it's weird."
  - **Reason**: Stigmatizes stimming, promotes masking
  - ✅ **Corrected**: "You're excited! How do you feel?" (flapping, jumping, verbal ALL valid)

**Ethical Safeguards**:
- **Mandatory Autistic Advocate Review** prevents ableist content
- **No punishment for non-engagement** (walking away without responding is NOT marked incorrect)
- **Representation matters**: Openly autistic peer characters with natural autistic traits
- **Communication diversity**: AAC, sign language, non-verbal ALL equally valid

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY ORDER

### Recommended Development Sequence

**PRIORITY 1 - Foundation Games** (Months 1-4):
1. **Game 01 (Color Matching)** - Simplest, builds confidence
2. **Game 02 (Emotion Recognition)** - High ROI, universally needed skill
3. **Game 03 (Counting Adventure)** - Academic skill, parent demand

**PRIORITY 2 - Communication Skills** (Months 5-8):
4. **Game 04 (Requesting Skills)** - Critical functional communication
5. **Game 05 (Following Directions)** - Classroom prerequisite
6. **Game 09 (Letter Land)** - Early literacy, school readiness

**PRIORITY 3 - Advanced Skills** (Months 9-14):
7. **Game 06 (Pattern Builder)** - Cognitive flexibility
8. **Game 08 (Fine Motor Mastery)** - Daily living independence
9. **Game 10 (Daily Routines)** - Life skills, parent-requested

**PRIORITY 4 - Social Skills** (Months 15-18):
10. **Game 07 (Social Scenarios)** - LAST (requires extensive Autistic Advocate review)

**Rationale**:
- **Build expertise** with simpler games before tackling complex ones
- **Revenue earlier** by releasing foundational games first
- **Autistic Advocate availability** - save Game 07 for when relationship established
- **OT/SLP collaboration** - stagger games requiring specialized sign-offs
