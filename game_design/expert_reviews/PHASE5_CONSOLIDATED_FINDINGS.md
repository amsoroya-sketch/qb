## CRITICAL BLOCKERS (MUST FIX BEFORE DEVELOPMENT)

### BLOCKER #1: GAME 07 (SOCIAL SCENARIOS) - AUTISTIC-001 VETO

**Severity**: üö® **CRITICAL - DEVELOPMENT BLOCKED**
**Reviewer**: AUTISTIC-001 (Autistic Self-Advocate)
**Impact**: Game 07 cannot proceed to development until ALL 5 issues resolved

**Required Revisions**:

1. **Eye Contact Language Audit** (HIGH SEVERITY):
   - **Issue**: Scenario animations may implicitly show eye contact as "correct" engagement
   - **Required Action**: All scenario animations must show MULTIPLE engagement styles
     - Looking at peer's face (ONE option, not default)
     - Looking at peer's hands/fidget toy
     - Looking at own hands while nodding
     - Using AAC while looking at device
     - Parallel attention (sitting beside, not facing)
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: AUTISTIC-001 must approve EVERY scenario animation
   - **Estimated Fix Time**: 5-7 days (redesign all 20+ scenario interactions)

2. **"Appropriate" Language Changed to "Functional"** (MEDIUM SEVERITY):
   - **Issue**: Code uses `AppropriatenessLevel` enum - implies neurotypical social judgment
   - **Required Action**:
     ```csharp
     // OLD:
     public enum AppropriatenessLevel { NotAppropriate, Acceptable, Appropriate, Ideal }

     // NEW:
     public enum CommunicationClarity { Unclear, NeedsRepair, Clear, VeryDear }
     ```
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Replace all instances of "appropriate" with "clear/functional"
   - **Estimated Fix Time**: 2 days (code refactor + UX copy rewrite)

3. **Walking Away = Valid Self-Regulation** (HIGH SEVERITY):
   - **Issue**: Current code marks walking away as error
   - **Required Action**:
     ```csharp
     // OLD:
     IF: Player walks away ‚Üí "Error" ‚Üí Retry

     // NEW:
     IF: Player walks away ‚Üí "Self-regulation success" ‚Üí Offer break
     ```
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Walking away tracked as POSITIVE self-advocacy, not failure
   - **Estimated Fix Time**: 3 days (game logic + data schema changes)

4. **Add Peer Acceptance Scenarios** (MEDIUM SEVERITY):
   - **Issue**: ALL scenarios teach autistic child to adapt to neurotypical norms (one-directional)
   - **Required Action**: Add 5-10 scenarios where player role-plays neurotypical peer learning to accept autistic communication
   - **Examples**:
     - "Your friend uses an AAC device. What do you do?" ‚Üí "Wait patiently"
     - "Your friend is stimming. What do you do?" ‚Üí "Keep playing! That's how they feel happy."
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Bidirectional social skills teaching
   - **Estimated Fix Time**: 4-5 days (design + implement new scenarios)

5. **Multiplayer Emotional Check-In** (LOW-MEDIUM SEVERITY):
   - **Issue**: Autistic children bullied at 3x rates - need post-session safety check
   - **Required Action**: Add post-multiplayer check-in:
     - "How did playing with [peer] feel?" (Good / Okay / Not good)
     - If "Not good", alert parent
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Simple emotional safety net
   - **Estimated Fix Time**: 1-2 days (UI + parent notification system)

**Total Fix Time for Game 07**: **15-21 days** (3-4 weeks)

**Go/No-Go Decision**:
- ‚úÖ **GO**: If team commits to 3-4 week revision timeline
- ‚ùå **NO-GO**: If timeline unacceptable, DEFER Game 07 to Phase 2 (post-launch)

**PM-001 Recommendation**: **DEFER Game 07** to post-launch. Prioritize 9 approved games first.

---

### BLOCKER #2: GAME 08 (FINE MOTOR) - OT INTERACTION MODEL REVIEW

**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH - CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**
**Reviewer**: OT-001 (Occupational Therapist)
**Impact**: Game 08 can proceed to development AFTER OT approves interaction models

**Required Actions**:

1. **Create Interaction Mockups** for all 9 stations:
   - Video prototypes showing finger/hand movements
   - Button station: Pinch gesture, push through hole
   - Zipper station: Up-down motion with force feedback
   - Shoelace station: Loop-swoop-pull sequence
   - Etc.

2. **OT-001 Reviews Mockups**:
   - Validates anatomical accuracy
   - Ensures real-world motor skill transfer
   - Provides age-based success criteria

3. **Add Disclaimer**:
   - "This game supplements but does NOT replace practice with real objects"

**Estimated Time**:
- Mockup creation: 3 days
- OT review: 2-3 days (includes revision cycle)
- Total delay: **5-6 days** (can be done in parallel with dev)

**Go/No-Go Decision**:
- ‚úÖ **GO**: Proceed with Game 08 development, mockups reviewed in parallel (Week 2)
- ‚ùå **NO-GO**: If OT vetos interaction models, significant redesign (2+ weeks delay)

**PM-001 Recommendation**: **PROCEED** - OT collaboration timeline is acceptable

```
Level 1: 1-word mands ("cookie")
Level 2: 2-word mands ("want cookie")
Level 3: 3-word mands ("I want cookie")
```

**Estimated Fix Time**: 3 days (game logic + UI adjustments)

**PM-001 Recommendation**: **FIX BEFORE LAUNCH** (clinically important)

---

### REVISION #3: GAME 09 - PHONICS SEQUENCE VALIDATION

**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**
**Reviewer**: SLP-001
**Issue**: Letter introduction order not specified (continuous sounds vs. stop sounds)

**Required Action**:
- Specify research-based sequence (Carnine et al., 2006):
  1. Continuous sounds first: m, s, f, a, r, l, i (easier to blend)
  2. Stop sounds later: b, p, t, d, k, g (harder to blend)

**Estimated Fix Time**: 1 day (update letter sequence array)

**PM-001 Recommendation**: **FIX BEFORE LAUNCH** (prevents teaching errors)

---

## MEDIUM-PRIORITY REVISIONS (CAN FIX DURING DEVELOPMENT)

### REVISION #4: AAC SYMBOL LIBRARY STANDARDIZATION (GAMES 02, 04)

**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW-MEDIUM**
**Reviewer**: SLP-001

**Required Action**:
- Choose ONE primary symbol set: **Boardmaker PCS** (most widely used)
- Provide alternative symbol packs for SymbolStix, Tobii users (downloadable)

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2 days (license Boardmaker PCS, create symbol mapping)

**PM-001 Recommendation**: FIX DURING DEVELOPMENT (non-blocking)

---

### REVISION #5: GAME 10 - OT TASK ANALYSIS TABLES

**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW**
**Reviewer**: OT-001
**Issue**: Need age-based difficulty levels for routines

**Required Action**:
