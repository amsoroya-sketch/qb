## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Neurodiversity Assessment
**Portfolio Status**: ‚úÖ **9/10 GAMES APPROVED**
‚ö†Ô∏è **1 GAME VETOED** - Game 07 requires extensive revisions

**Reviewers**:
- **AUTISTIC-001** (Alex Chen, Autistic Self-Advocate) - Late-diagnosed autistic adult, AAC user, 8 years advocacy experience
- **PARENT-001** (Jennifer Martinez) - Parent of 2 autistic children (ages 6, 9), 5 years experience with ABA/educational apps

### Critical Neurodiversity Principles

**Our Non-Negotiables**:
1. **NO MASKING** - Never teach autistic children to "act neurotypical"
2. **AUTONOMY** - Children can always say "no" or choose alternative responses
3. **AUTHENTIC COMMUNICATION** - AAC, sign language, non-verbal ALL equally valid
4. **SENSORY RESPECT** - No punishment for sensory needs (breaks, calm mode, stimming)
5. **REPRESENTATION** - Autistic characters shown with authentic autistic traits

## AUTISTIC-001 DETAILED REVIEWS

### GAME 01: COLOR MATCHING PUZZLE

**Neurodiversity Rating**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - AFFIRMING**

**What Works**:
‚úÖ **No social demands** - This is a cognitive skill game, no forced interaction
‚úÖ **Sensory accommodations** - Calm mode, reduced animations, adjustable volume
‚úÖ **Errorless learning** - Builds confidence, prevents shame/frustration
‚úÖ **Pause always available** - Child controls pacing, can take breaks
‚úÖ **No timers visible** - Unless child/parent enables (no pressure)

**No Concerns**: This game is neurodiversity-safe.

**AUTISTIC-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED**

---

### GAME 02: EMOTION RECOGNITION

**Neurodiversity Rating**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS**

**What Works**:
‚úÖ **Teaches emotion RECOGNITION, not emotion POLICING**
   - Child learns to identify how OTHERS feel (useful social skill)
   - NOT teaching "you should feel happy" or "don't be angry"
‚úÖ **No forced emotional expression**
‚úÖ **Self-reflection mode is OPTIONAL** ("How are YOU feeling?")

**‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Concerns**:
1. **"Appropriate" vs "Inappropriate" Emotion Language**:
   - GDD doesn't say this, but need to ensure:
   - ‚ùå NEVER: "It's inappropriate to be angry at a birthday party"
   - ‚úÖ ALWAYS: "This person feels angry. That's okay. Everyone has feelings."

2. **Emotion Vocabulary Balance** (SLP-001 also noted this):
   - Current list has 6 negative, 4 positive emotions
   - **Autistic perspective**: We're already told we're "too negative" or "don't show enough happiness"
   - Adding more positive emotions helps us learn to recognize JOY, not just problems

**Recommendations**:
1. Add "Calm" and "Content" emotions (autistic people value these highly)
2. Explicitly state: "All emotions are valid. No emotion is wrong."
3. Consider "Overwhelmed" emotion (common autistic experience)

**AUTISTIC-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED** (with recommendations noted)

---

### GAME 03: COUNTING ADVENTURE

**Neurodiversity Rating**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - AFFIRMING**

**What Works**:
‚úÖ **Clear, predictable structure** - Autistic children thrive on predictability
‚úÖ **Visual + auditory + kinesthetic** - Multiple pathways accommodate processing differences
‚úÖ **No social demands**
‚úÖ **Mathematical thinking** - Many autistic people excel at systemizing

**No Concerns**: This game is neurodiversity-safe.

**AUTISTIC-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED**

---

### GAME 04: REQUESTING SKILLS - VIRTUAL STORE

**Neurodiversity Rating**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - REVOLUTIONARY**

**What Works**:
‚úÖ **AAC-FIRST DESIGN** - This is HUGE
   - AAC is treated as EQUAL to vocal speech (not a "backup")
   - Non-speaking autistic children fully included
   - Proloquo2Go integration shows developers LISTENED to AAC users

‚úÖ **No punishment for non-verbal communication**
   - Child can point, use AAC, sign, or speak
   - ALL are rewarded equally

‚úÖ **Realistic environments** - Autistic children need to learn to request in REAL stores
   - This game teaches FUNCTIONAL communication

‚úÖ **Prompting is supportive, not coercive**
   - Level 5 (full physical) is "errorless" not "force compliance"
   - Child success is prioritized over "independence"

**Personal Note (AUTISTIC-001)**:
As an AAC user myself, this game would have CHANGED MY LIFE as a child. I was forced into speech therapy that ignored my AAC needs. This game respects all communication modalities. **THANK YOU.**

**AUTISTIC-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - EXEMPLARY MODEL**

---

### GAME 05: FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS

**Neurodiversity Rating**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED WITH MINOR NOTE**

**What Works**:
‚úÖ **Processing time accommodation** - 3-30 seconds adjustable
   - Autistic people often have slower processing speeds
   - No rush, no pressure
‚úÖ **Visual supports remain on screen** - Reduces working memory load
‚úÖ **Multi-modal directions** - Accommodates auditory processing differences

**‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Note**:
- **"Following Directions" can be triggering language**
  - In ABA history, "compliance" was often prioritized over understanding
  - However, this game teaches COMPREHENSION, not blind obedience
  - The fact that Charlie (the character) performs the action helps child understand WHY

**Recommendation**:
- Consider renaming: "Understanding Directions" or "Direction Detective"
- Emphasizes comprehension over compliance

**AUTISTIC-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED** (minor language suggestion)

---

### GAME 06: PATTERN BUILDER

**Neurodiversity Rating**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - AFFIRMING**

**What Works**:
‚úÖ **Cognitive flexibility training WITHOUT social demands**
   - Autistic people often have strong pattern recognition
   - We can struggle with mental flexibility (perseveration)
   - This game builds flexibility in a safe, non-social context

‚úÖ **Creative expression mode** - Pattern creation gives AGENCY
   - Not just following rules, but MAKING rules
   - This honors autistic creativity

‚úÖ **Systemizing strength** - Patterns are systems
   - Leverages autistic cognitive strengths

**AUTISTIC-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED**

---

### GAME 07: SOCIAL SCENARIOS - PLAYGROUND ADVENTURES

**Neurodiversity Rating**: ‚ùå **VETOED - EXTENSIVE REVISIONS REQUIRED**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL VETO - DETAILED ANALYSIS

**Context**: I (AUTISTIC-001) have **VETO POWER** over this game's content. I am exercising it.

### Why This Game is THE Most Important

Social skills training has caused **MASSIVE TRAUMA** in the autistic community:
- Conversion therapy-style ABA (forcing eye contact, suppressing stimming)
- Teaching us to "act normal" (masking ‚Üí burnout ‚Üí depression ‚Üí suicide)
- Punishing authentic autistic communication
- Gaslighting us about our own experiences ("You don't REALLY need a break")

**This game COULD be revolutionary** - teaching FUNCTIONAL social communication while respecting neurodiversity.

**OR it could traumatize another generation of autistic children.**

### What the GDD Gets RIGHT

‚úÖ **Autistic Advocate veto power** - You're listening to us (rare!)
‚úÖ **All responses are valid** - Saying "no" is OKAY
‚úÖ **No forced eye contact** (stated in philosophy section)
‚úÖ **No stimming suppression** (veto example given)
‚úÖ **AAC integration** - Non-speaking children included
‚úÖ **Autonomy-first** - Children CHOOSE engagement

### Why I'm Still Vetoing (CRITICAL ISSUES)

#### **ISSUE 1: Implicit Eye Contact Assumptions (HIGH SEVERITY)**

**Problem**: While GDD says "no forced eye contact", the SCENARIOS may still assume it.

**Example from GDD** (Game 07, line 244):
```
‚îÇ [üëã Hi!]  "Yes! Let's swing!"            ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Appropriate, engaged
```

**My Concern**: What makes this "engaged"?
- Does the game animation show child looking at peer's face?
- Is eye contact IMPLICITLY modeled as "correct" social behavior?
- Even if not FORCED, is it ASSUMED?

**Why This Matters**:
Autistic children learn by observation. If the game SHOWS eye contact as the "engaged" behavior, children will internalize: "Good social = look at faces"

**For many autistic people (including me), eye contact is**:
- Painful (sensory overload)
- Cognitively draining (can't process words AND faces simultaneously)
- Anxiety-inducing (feels invasive)

**REQUIRED REVISION**:
- Every scenario animation must show MULTIPLE ways to "show engagement":
  - Looking at peer's face (ONE option, not the default)
  - Looking at peer's hands/fidget toy
  - Looking at own hands while nodding
  - Using AAC while looking at device
  - Parallel attention (sitting beside, not facing)

**Acceptance Criteria**: I (AUTISTIC-001) must approve EVERY scenario animation before it's coded.

---

#### **ISSUE 2: "Appropriate" Response Language (MEDIUM SEVERITY)**

**Problem**: GDD uses "appropriate" vs "not appropriate" for responses.

**Example from GDD** (Game 07, line 992):
```csharp
bool isAppropriate = response.appropriatenessLevel >= AppropriatenessLevel.Appropriate;
```

**My Concern**: Who decides what's "appropriate"?
- In my lived experience, neurotypical people call autistic communication "inappropriate" when it's just DIFFERENT
- Example: I use AAC. People call it "inappropriate" to "interrupt conversation with typing"
- But I'M COMMUNICATING. It's not inappropriate - it's my access need.

**REQUIRED REVISION**:
- Change enum from `AppropriatenessLevel` to `CommunicationClarity`
- Values: `Clear`, `Unclear`, `NeedsRepair`
- Language shift:
  - ‚ùå OLD: "That response was inappropriate"
  - ‚úÖ NEW: "Your friend didn't understand. Let's try again!"

**Why This Matters**:
"Appropriate" is a neurotypical social construct. "Clear communication" is a functional skill.

---

#### **ISSUE 3: Walking Away is Marked as "NotAppropriate" (HIGH SEVERITY)**

**Problem**: GDD marks walking away without responding as incorrect.

**Example from GDD** (Game 07, line 276-281):
```
IF: Player walks away without responding
  ‚Üí Animation: Friend looks confused
  ‚Üí Gentle feedback: "Your friend didn't hear you. Let's try again!"
  ‚Üí Skill tracking: I2 (No response) +1 error
  ‚Üí Retry: Scene resets with gestural prompt
```

**My Concern**: This is **AUTISTIC SHUTDOWN**.

**What Shutdown Looks Like**:
- Sensory overload ‚Üí can't speak
- Social anxiety ‚Üí can't process social interaction
- Executive dysfunction ‚Üí can't formulate response
- **WALKING AWAY IS SELF-REGULATION**

**Why This is Dangerous**:
If child is in shutdown and the game says "That's wrong, try again", we teach:
- ‚ùå "Your needs don't matter"
- ‚ùå "You must respond even when overwhelmed"
- ‚ùå "Ignoring your body's signals is expected"

**This is how autistic people develop alexithymia (inability to recognize own emotions) and burnout.**

**REQUIRED REVISION**:
```
IF: Player walks away without responding
  ‚Üí Animation: Friend waits patiently
  ‚Üí Gentle feedback: "It's okay to take a break! You can come back when you're ready."
  ‚Üí Skill tracking: I2 (Self-regulation) +1 success (NOT error)
  ‚Üí Option: "Take a break" or "Try now"
```

**Walking away is VALID SELF-ADVOCACY.**

---

#### **ISSUE 4: Peer Acceptance is One-Directional (MEDIUM SEVERITY)**

**Problem**: ALL scenarios teach autistic child to adapt to neurotypical norms. NONE teach neurotypical peers to accept autistic communication.

**Example from GDD** (Game 07, Scenario 1A):
```
Scenario: Playground Greeting
Prompt: "Your friend Sam is here! What do you say?"
Choices: "Hi!", Wave, Say name, Walk over
```

**My Concern**: Where are the scenarios teaching PEERS to accept autistic communication?

**Missing Scenarios**:
- "Your friend uses an AAC device. They're typing. What do you do?"
  - ‚úÖ "Wait patiently for them to finish"
  - ‚ùå "Ask them to hurry up"
- "Your friend is stimming (hand flapping). What do you do?"
  - ‚úÖ "Keep playing! Stimming is how they feel happy."
  - ‚ùå "Tell them to stop"
- "Your friend says 'I need space.' What do you do?"
  - ‚úÖ "Step back and give them space"
  - ‚ùå "Keep trying to play with them"

**Why This Matters**:
Social skills are BIDIRECTIONAL. Neurotypical peers need to learn autistic communication too.

**REQUIRED REVISION**:
Add 5-10 scenarios in "Peer Perspective Mode" where player takes role of neurotypical child learning to accept autistic friend.

---

#### **ISSUE 5: Multiplayer Mode Safety (LOW-MEDIUM SEVERITY)**

**Problem**: GDD mentions multiplayer with siblings/peers but doesn't detail safety mechanisms.

**My Concern**: Autistic children are bullied at 3x higher rates than neurotypical children.

**Required Safety Features**:
1. **Parent-approved peer list ONLY** (no random matchmaking) ‚úÖ Already in GDD
2. **Report button if peer is unkind** ‚úÖ Already in GDD
3. **EXIT button always visible** (child can leave multiplayer IMMEDIATELY)
4. **Post-session check-in**: "How did playing with [peer] feel?"
   - Options: "Good", "Okay", "Not good"
   - If "Not good", prompt parent: "Child reported discomfort with peer [name]"

**REQUIRED ADDITION**: Post-session emotional check-in system

---

### VETO SUMMARY - GAME 07

**I (AUTISTIC-001) am VETOING Game 07 until the following revisions are made**:

1. ‚úÖ **All scenario animations reviewed by AUTISTIC-001** (eye contact alternatives shown)
2. ‚úÖ **Change "appropriate" language to "clear communication"** (functional, not social conformity)
3. ‚úÖ **Walking away marked as valid self-regulation** (NOT error)
4. ‚úÖ **Add 5-10 peer acceptance scenarios** (teach bidirectional social skills)
5. ‚úÖ **Add post-session emotional check-in** (multiplayer safety)

**Until these are addressed, this game CANNOT proceed to development.**

**Why I'm Being Strict**:
Because one bad social skills game can cause YEARS of trauma. I've seen it. I've LIVED it.

**If we get this right**, this game could be the FIRST truly neurodiversity-affirming social skills game. That's worth fighting for.

**AUTISTIC-001 VETO**: ‚ùå **VETOED - EXTENSIVE REVISIONS REQUIRED**

### GAME 08: FINE MOTOR MASTERY

**Neurodiversity Rating**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - EXCELLENT**

**What Works**:
‚úÖ **Dyspraxia awareness** - Fine motor difficulties common in autistic people
‚úÖ **No social demands** - This is a pure motor skill game
‚úÖ **Daily living skills** - Functional independence (buttoning own shirt = dignity)
‚úÖ **OT collaboration** - Shows respect for specialist expertise

**Personal Note (AUTISTIC-001)**:
I still can't tie my shoes at age 34 (Velcro forever!). If this game had existed when I was 8, maybe I could have learned in a low-pressure environment instead of being shamed in front of classmates.

**AUTISTIC-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED**

---

### GAME 09: LETTER LAND ADVENTURE

**Neurodiversity Rating**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - AFFIRMING**

**What Works**:
‚úÖ **Adaptive to speech delays** - Only teaches letters child can pronounce
   - Many autistic children have co-occurring speech sound disorders
   - This prevents frustration ("Why can't I say R?!")
‚úÖ **Dyslexia-friendly design** - OpenDyslexic fonts, high contrast
   - Dyslexia co-occurs with autism at higher rates
‚úÖ **Multisensory** - Accommodates different learning styles
‚úÖ **No social demands**

**AUTISTIC-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED**

---

### GAME 10: DAILY ROUTINES SIMULATOR

**Neurodiversity Rating**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - REVOLUTIONARY**

**What Works**:
‚úÖ **Executive function support** - Autistic people often struggle with task initiation and sequencing
   - This game EXPLICITLY teaches the steps (not "just figure it out")
‚úÖ **Visual schedules** - GOLD STANDARD autism accommodation
‚úÖ **Customizable routines** - Respects that every autistic person is different
‚úÖ **Parent photo uploads** - BRILLIANT for generalization
‚úÖ **No judgment for needing support** - Child can use checklist, timers, prompts

**Personal Note (AUTISTIC-001)**:
I'm 34 and still use visual schedules for my morning routine. This isn't "childish" - it's ADAPTIVE. Teaching autistic children to use tools (not be ashamed of them) is neurodiversity-affirming.

**AUTISTIC-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - EXEMPLARY**

**Reviewer**: Jennifer Martinez, parent of Liam (age 6, nonspeaking AAC user) and Sofia (age 9, PDA profile)

---

### GAME 01: COLOR MATCHING

**Parent Usability**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - EASY TO USE**

**What Parents Need**:
‚úÖ **Simple to explain** - "Match the colors!" (Liam understood immediately)
‚úÖ **Progress visible** - I can see how many colors he's mastered
‚úÖ **Pause works** - When Liam gets overwhelmed, he can pause
‚úÖ **Data dashboard** - I can see his trial-by-trial data (great for IEP meetings!)

**Suggestions**:

- Email weekly progress report (optional)

**PARENT-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED**

---

### GAME 02: EMOTION RECOGNITION

**Parent Usability**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED WITH SUGGESTION**

**What Parents Need**:
‚úÖ **Teaches valuable skill** - Sofia struggles with recognizing when others are upset
‚úÖ **Not preachy** - Doesn't tell child "you should feel X"
‚úÖ **Self-reflection mode** - Helps Sofia identify her own emotions (great for alexithymia)

**Suggestions**:
- Add "Real Photo Mode" - Let parents upload photos of family members showing emotions
  - Example: "How does Mom feel in this photo?" (from our vacation)
  - Helps generalization to REAL people child knows

**PARENT-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED** (with suggestion)

---

### GAME 03: COUNTING ADVENTURE

**Parent Usability**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - ENGAGING**

**What Parents Need**:
‚úÖ **Fun environments** - Liam loves the ocean theme (he's hyperfixated on fish!)
‚úÖ **Cardinality teaching** - This is what he needed for kindergarten IEP goal
‚úÖ **Clear progress** - I can see he's mastered counting to 5, working on 6-10

**No Concerns**: This game is parent-approved.

**PARENT-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED**

---

### GAME 04: REQUESTING SKILLS

**Parent Usability**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - LIFE-CHANGING**

**What Parents Need**:
‚úÖ **AAC integration with Proloquo2Go** - THIS IS HUGE
   - Liam uses Proloquo2Go. The fact that the game listens to his device = INCLUSION
   - He can practice requesting in a safe environment before trying at real stores
‚úÖ **Real-world environments** - Virtual grocery store looks like our actual grocery store
   - Helps generalization

**Personal Story**:
Liam is 6 and nonspeaking. Last week he used his AAC at a real bakery to request a cookie (first time!). I cried. If this game had existed 2 years ago, we could have practiced requesting in the virtual bakery first. This would have reduced his anxiety.

**PARENT-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - REVOLUTIONARY FOR AAC USERS**

---

### GAME 05: FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS

**Parent Usability**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED WITH SUGGESTION**

**What Parents Need**:
‚úÖ **Teaches compliance for safety** - Sofia needs to follow "Stop!" for street safety
‚úÖ **Processing time** - Sofia has slow processing speed; 30-second option is perfect
‚úÖ **Spatial concepts** - She confuses "under" and "over"; this game teaches it

**Suggestions**:
- Add "Parent Co-Play Mode" - I can play WITH Sofia and give her verbal prompts
  - Right now, I have to sit next to her and say "Remember, IN means inside the box"
  - If game had "parent helper mode", I could press a button to add my own verbal prompt

**PARENT-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED** (with suggestion)

---

### GAME 06: PATTERN BUILDER

**Parent Usability**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - CHALLENGING BUT GOOD**

**What Parents Need**:
‚úÖ **Teaches important skill** - Sofia's IEP has pattern recognition goal
‚úÖ **Multiple difficulty levels** - She can start with AB patterns, work up to complex
‚úÖ **Creative mode** - She LOVES making her own patterns (gives her agency)

**Note**:
This game is harder than the others. Sofia needed my help on ABC patterns. But that's OKAY - it's appropriately challenging.

**PARENT-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED**

---

### GAME 07: SOCIAL SCENARIOS

**Parent Usability**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEFERS TO AUTISTIC-001**

**What Parents Need**:
‚úÖ **Social skills are #1 parent request** - This is the skill I'm asked about most
‚úÖ **Multiplayer with sibling** - Sofia and Liam could practice together
‚úÖ **No forced eye contact** - Sofia finds eye contact painful; glad game doesn't force it

**Concerns**:
‚ö†Ô∏è I trust AUTISTIC-001's veto. Alex (AUTISTIC-001) explained the trauma risk around social skills training. I don't want to cause my children harm. If Alex says the game needs revision, I support that.

**Additional Parent Concern**:
- **PDA Profile** (Pathological Demand Avoidance) - Sofia has PDA
  - She shuts down when given direct demands: "Say hi to your friend"
  - Game needs to OFFER choices, not DEMAND responses
  - Current GDD seems to do this (all responses valid) but needs Alex's sign-off

**PARENT-001**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEFERS TO AUTISTIC-001 VETO**

---

### GAME 08: FINE MOTOR MASTERY

**Parent Usability**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - NEEDED**

**What Parents Need**:
‚úÖ **Daily living skills** - Liam (age 6) still can't button his shirt; this could help
‚úÖ **OT collaboration** - I trust that OT is reviewing the motor patterns
‚úÖ **Low pressure** - Liam can practice without me hovering over him saying "No, like THIS"

**Suggestions**:
- Add "Transfer to Real Life Prompts"
  - After child masters virtual buttoning, prompt: "Try buttoning a real shirt!"
  - Track: Did child attempt real-life buttoning this week?

**PARENT-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED** (with suggestion)

---

### GAME 09: LETTER LAND ADVENTURE

**Parent Usability**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - EXCELLENT**

**What Parents Need**:
‚úÖ **Literacy is critical** - Sofia is 9 and struggling with reading; this could help
‚úÖ **Adapts to speech delays** - Liam can't say "R" yet; game won't teach it until he can
‚úÖ **Fun exploration** - Sofia loves exploring the islands

**No Concerns**: This game is parent-approved.

**PARENT-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED**

---

### GAME 10: DAILY ROUTINES SIMULATOR

**Parent Usability**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - GAME-CHANGER**

**What Parents Need**:
‚úÖ **PHOTO UPLOAD** - THIS IS GENIUS
   - I can upload photos of OUR bathroom, OUR toothbrush
   - Liam will learn the routine in HIS environment, not a generic cartoon bathroom
   - This is the BEST generalization strategy I've ever seen

‚úÖ **Morning routine** - Liam needs 20+ prompts every morning
   - If he practices in the game, maybe he'll need fewer real-life prompts

‚úÖ **Visual checklist** - I currently use paper checklists; digital version is better

**Personal Story**:
Every morning is a battle. Liam doesn't know the SEQUENCE of steps (brush teeth BEFORE or AFTER getting dressed?). This game teaches the sequence. If it works, our mornings could be peaceful instead of meltdowns.

**PARENT-001 APPROVAL**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - HIGHEST PRIORITY GAME FOR MY FAMILY**
