## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Risk 1: Game 07 Revisions Take Longer Than Expected
**Mitigation**: DEFER to Phase 2 (already planned)
**Impact**: Zero (9 other games provide value)

### Risk 2: AAC Integration (Game 04) Fails
**Mitigation**: In-game AAC board fallback (works without external devices)
**Impact**: Medium (reduced value, but still functional)

### Risk 3: Beta Tester Recruitment Falls Short
**Mitigation**: Partner with autism parent Facebook groups (100K+ members)
**Impact**: Low (high demand for autism educational apps)

### Risk 4: Revenue Below Projections
**Mitigation**: Adjust pricing ($14.99 ‚Üí $19.99), add school licensing tier
**Impact**: Medium (may delay break-even by 2-3 months)

### Risk 5: WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Failures
**Mitigation**: Weekly accessibility audits starting Month 1
**Impact**: Low (built into timeline)
