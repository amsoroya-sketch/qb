● I'll continue creating SECURITY_NEXT_STEPS.md files for the remaining projects. Let me start with MoneySmart-v2 and kidsGames.

● Let me check if MoneySmart-v2 already has a SECURITY_NEXT_STEPS.md file:

● Search(pattern: "**/MoneySmart*/*SECURITY*.md", path: "~/Development")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Search(pattern: "**/kidsGames/*SECURITY*.md", path: "~/Development")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Now let me create SECURITY_NEXT_STEPS.md for MoneySmart-v2. Based on the comprehensive analysis, MoneySmart-v2 has an A grade (95/100) and is the
  best-in-class reference implementation. Let me create an appropriate next steps file:

● Write(~/Development/MoneySmart-v2/SECURITY_NEXT_STEPS.md)

  Key Features of All Files

  Each SECURITY_NEXT_STEPS.md includes:
  - ✅ Current security grade and status
  - ✅ Prioritized action plan (P0/P1/P2/P3)
  - ✅ Exact commands and full code implementations
  - ✅ Estimated timelines for each task
  - ✅ Verification checklists
  - ✅ References to COMPREHENSIVE_SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md
  - ✅ Success criteria and target grades

  These files will be automatically picked up by Claude when working on each respective project, providing immediate security context and actionable
   guidance.
