● I'll continue with Day 1 of the Hugging Face setup. Let me activate the virtual environment and install the required packages.

● Bash(source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate && pip install huggingface_hub transformers torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121) timeout: 5m 0s

     ERROR: No matching distribution found for huggingface_hub

     Looking in indexes: https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

● The PyTorch index doesn't have the Hugging Face packages. Let me install them separately - first the Hugging Face packages from PyPI, then PyTorch with CUDA support:

● Good! The first install timed out but was still installing packages. The PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 installed successfully. Now let me verify the installations:

● Bash(source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate && python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch Version: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA Available: {torch.cuda.is_availab…)
  ⎿  PyTorch Version: 2.5.1+cu121                  
     CUDA Available: True
     CUDA Version: 12.1
     GPU Device: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU

● Bash(source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate && huggingface-cli --version)
  ⎿  Error: /bin/bash: line 1: huggingface-cli: command not found

● Excellent! PyTorch with CUDA is working perfectly - detecting the RTX 4070 Laptop GPU. The first install likely completed in the background. Let me check if huggingface_hub was
  installed and verify the CLI:

● Bash(source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate && python -c "import huggingface_hub; print(f'Hugging Face Hub Version: {huggingface_hub.__version__}')")
  ⎿  Error: Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
     ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'huggingface_hub'

● Bash(source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate && which huggingface-cli)
  ⎿  Error: Error

● The first installation timed out before completing. Let me update the todo list and reinstall the Hugging Face packages:

● Bash(source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate && pip install --no-cache-dir huggingface_hub transformers diffusers accelerate safetensors) timeout: 3m 0s
  ⎿  Collecting huggingface_hub

     Collecting transformers
     … +104 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Now let me verify all installations are complete:

● Bash(source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate && python -c "import huggingface_hub, transformers, diffusers, accelerate, safetensors; print('✓ All Hugging Face packages…)
  ⎿  ✓ All Hugging Face packages installed
     huggingface_hub: 0.35.3
     transformers: 4.57.0
     diffusers: 0.35.1

● Bash(source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate && huggingface-cli --version)
  ⎿  Error: usage: huggingface-cli <command> [<args>]
     huggingface-cli: error: unrecognized arguments: --version

● Great! Everything is installed. Let me check the proper CLI command:

● Bash(source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate && huggingface-cli env)
  ⎿  ⚠️  Warning: 'huggingface-cli env' is deprecated. Use 'hf env' instead.

● Excellent! The environment is set up perfectly. Key observation: Has saved token ?: False - which means we need to authenticate. Now I need to guide you through the manual
  authentication steps since these require interaction with the Hugging Face website.

  Day 1 Progress Summary - Installation Complete!

  ✓ Successfully Completed:
  - Created virtual environment at ~/ai-tools/hf-env
  - Installed PyTorch 2.5.1 with CUDA 12.1 support
  - Detected RTX 4070 Laptop GPU successfully
  - Installed all Hugging Face packages:
    - huggingface_hub 0.35.3
    - transformers 4.57.0
    - diffusers 0.35.1
    - accelerate, safetensors, and dependencies

  Next Steps: Manual Authentication (You Need to Do This)

  Since these steps require web browser interaction, please complete them:

  Step 1: Create Hugging Face Account (if you don't have one)

  Go to: https://huggingface.co/join

  Step 2: Accept FLUX.1-schnell Model License

  Go to: https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell
  - Click "Agree and access repository"
  - This is required to download the model

  Step 3: Generate Access Token

  Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
  - Click "New token"
  - Name it: "skillbridge-local-dev"
  - Type: Select "Read" (sufficient for downloading models)
  - Click "Create token"
  - Copy the token (you'll need it in the next step)

  Step 4: Authenticate CLI

  Once you have your token copied, run this command:

  source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate
  huggingface-cli login

  When prompted, paste your access token and press Enter.

  ---
  Let me know once you've completed these authentication steps, and I'll continue with the rest of Day 1:
  - Verify authentication with huggingface-cli whoami
  - Create test script for FLUX.1-schnell image generation
  - Download the model (12GB, will take 10-15 minutes)
  - Generate your first AI image!

> authentication is done move onto next step 

● Bash(source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate && huggingface-cli whoami)
  ⎿  ⚠️  Warning: 'huggingface-cli whoami' is deprecated. Use 'hf auth whoami' instead.
     soroya

● Perfect! Authentication successful - you're logged in as soroya.

  Now let's create a test script to generate your first AI image with FLUX.1-schnell. This will download the model (~12GB) and create a test image:

     import os

● Now let's run the test script. This will download the FLUX.1-schnell model (~12GB) on the first run, then generate your first AI image:
