       → Invoke FLUX-001 (FLUX Image Generation Expert)
       → Invoke COMFY-001 (ComfyUI Workflow Expert)

     IF game needs sound effects OR background music:
       → Invoke AUDIO-001 (Stable Audio Expert)

     IF game needs voice-overs OR instructions:
       → Invoke VOICE-001 (Bark Voice Expert)

     IF game needs 3D props OR interactive objects:
       → Invoke CUBE3D-001 (Cube 3D Model Expert)
       → Optional: BLENDER-001 (for post-processing)

     IF game engine is Godot:
       → Invoke GODOT-001 (Godot Engine Expert)

     IF game engine is Unity:
       → Invoke UNITY-EDU-001 (Unity Educational Expert)

     IF UI design needs tokens/components:
       → Invoke FIGMA-001 (Figma Design Tokens Expert)
       → Invoke REACT-001 (React Component Expert)

     Agent Coordination Workflow

     1. PM-001 analyzes game GDD → identifies resource needs
     2. PM-001 creates resource specification spreadsheet
     3. PM-001 assigns appropriate expert agents
     4. Expert agents work in parallel (where possible)
     5. PM-001 aggregates outputs → quality check
     6. If issues: feedback loop to experts for iteration
     7. Final assets delivered to game developer agents

> best practices, code snippets, what evere that will help while developing in those technologies. 

> it can be 7 to 800 lines 

● Perfect! The plan is approved. Now I'll create all 10 expert agent documentation files with 700-800 lines each, packed with best practices, code
  snippets, and expert knowledge. Let me start creating them using the Task tool to leverage Claude Opus for the highest quality output.

● Now I'll create all 10 expert agent files. Since these need to be comprehensive (700-800 lines each with expert knowledge, code samples, best
  practices), I'll create them directly with all the research I've gathered.

  Let me start by creating the first expert agent:

● Write(agent_system/agents/12_flux_image_expert.md)

● Good! 644 lines for the FLUX expert. Now I need to create the remaining 9 expert agents. Due to the length constraints and to provide
  comprehensive, expert-level documentation, let me create them all systematically. I'll use the Task tool to leverage Claude Opus for higher
  quality content generation for these comprehensive technical documents.

Access to model black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell is restricted. You must have access to it and be authenticated to access it. Please log in.
✗ FLUX.1 installation failed. Check /home/dev/ai-tools-setup.log for details. 

● The conversation was exported! Now I see you're running the FLUX AI setup script and encountered an authentication error with Hugging Face. The
  FLUX.1 model requires authentication. Let me help you fix this:

  Issue: Hugging Face Authentication Required

  The FLUX.1-schnell model is gated and requires you to:
  1. Create a Hugging Face account
  2. Accept the model's license agreement
  3. Authenticate with your token

  Solution:

● Bash(cat > ~/setup_flux_auth.sh << 'SCRIPT'
      #!/bin/bash…)
  ⎿  ===================================
     FLUX.1 Hugging Face Authentication
     ===================================
     … +26 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Quick Fix Commands:

  Run these commands in your terminal:

  # 1. Activate the FLUX environment
  source ~/ai-tools/flux-env/bin/activate

  # 2. Login to Hugging Face (will prompt for token)
  huggingface-cli login

  # When prompted, paste your token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

  Before you can login, you need to:
  1. Go to https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell
  2. Click "Agree and access repository" button
  3. Then create a token at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

  After authentication, re-run the setup:
  bash ~/ai-tools/setup_flux_ai.sh

  Note: FLUX.1-schnell is 100% commercial-safe (Apache 2.0 license) but requires you to agree to their terms first. This is just a one-time setup!

> create this task as a github issue I shall work on it later 

● I'll create a GitHub issue for setting up FLUX.1 authentication and installation.

● Bash(gh issue create --title "Setup FLUX.1 Hugging Face Authentication for AI Image Generation" --body "## Issue: FLUX.1 Model Download Requires
      Authentication…)
  ⎿  Error: /bin/bash: line 82: gh: command not found

● The gh CLI tool isn't installed. Let me create the issue file for you to manually create on GitHub:

● Write(ISSUE_flux_authentication.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 87 lines to ISSUE_flux_authentication.md                     
     # Setup FLUX.1 Hugging Face Authentication for AI Image Generation
     ## Issue: FLUX.1 Model Download Requires Authentication
     ### Problem
     The FLUX.1-schnell model download failed with authentication error:
     ```
     huggingface_hub.errors.GatedRepoError: 401 Client Error
     Access to model black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell is restricted.
     You must have access to it and be authenticated to access it.
     … +77 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(echo "GitHub Issue file created at:"
      echo "/home/dev/Development/kidsGames/ISSUE_flux_authentication.md"…)
  ⎿  GitHub Issue file created at:                               
     /home/dev/Development/kidsGames/ISSUE_flux_authentication.md
     … +6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! I've created the GitHub issue file at /home/dev/Development/kidsGames/ISSUE_flux_authentication.md.

  To create the issue on GitHub:

  1. Open your browser and go to: https://github.com/asimsoroya/kidsGames/issues/new
  2. Open the file ISSUE_flux_authentication.md in a text editor
  3. Copy all the contents and paste into the GitHub issue form
  4. Add these labels: setup, ai-tools, blocked-external, documentation
  5. Click "Submit new issue"

  Quick command to view the issue file:
  cat /home/dev/Development/kidsGames/ISSUE_flux_authentication.md

  The issue contains all the steps you need to authenticate with Hugging Face and complete the FLUX.1 setup later. Once you have your Hugging Face
  token, just follow the commands in the issue to complete the installation!
