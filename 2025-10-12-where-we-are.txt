● I'll formalize the workflow coordination system between the expert .md agents. Let me create a comprehensive agent coordination document that
  defines how all the expert agents work together through the 12-step workflow.

> 1. Complete Workflow System (12 Steps)

  ✅ Step 1: Skill Database → Game Idea Selection (SQL queries, PM review)
  ✅ Step 2: Auto-route to Autism Experts (skill-domain mapping)
  ✅ Step 3: Expert Game Designer starts concept (role confirmed: GAME-001 agent)
  ✅ Step 4: Design Validation with clinical experts (90-min meeting, feedback forms)
  ✅ Step 5: Technical Feasibility Review (Solution Architect assessment)
  ✅ Step 6: Tech Team Assembly + Technical Plan (identify devs, 60-min planning meeting)
  ✅ Step 7: Resource Specification (50+ assets cataloged: images, audio, UI)
  ✅ Step 8: AI-Assisted Resource Generation (DALL-E 3, Midjourney, ElevenLabs APIs)
  ✅ Step 9: PM Handoff to Senior Developer (organized asset delivery)
  ✅ Step 10: Unity Game Development (3-week timeline: foundation → build → polish)
  ✅ Step 11: Automated Testing + Hard Constraints (15 non-negotiable quality gates)
  ✅ Step 12: Expert Re-Assessment + Iteration Loop (changes flow back to PM until mature) 

● Now I'll create the formal agent coordination system that defines how all expert .md agents collaborate through each workflow step.

● Agent Coordination System Complete

  I've created the comprehensive Agent Coordination System document that formalizes how all 15+ expert .md agents work together through the 12-step
  game development workflow.

  Document Location

  /home/dev/Development/kidsGames/game_design/technical_specs/AGENT_COORDINATION_SYSTEM.md

  What's Included

  1. Agent Registry (Section 1)
  - 15+ agents categorized: Technical (PM, Architects, Developers), Clinical (BCBA, SLP, OT, Psychologist, Advocate), and Resource (AI Asset Team)
  - Role definitions and workflow step involvement mapping

  2. Step-by-Step Coordination (Section 2)
  Detailed agent interaction flows for all 12 steps:
  - Step 1: PM-001 runs SQL queries → selects underserved skills
  - Step 2: Auto-routing engine assigns experts based on skill domains
  - Step 3: GAME-001 + UX-001 create concept document
  - Step 4: Multi-agent design validation meeting (90 min) with conflict resolution protocols
  - Step 5: ARCH-001 feasibility assessment
  - Step 6: Tech planning meeting (6 agents coordinate)
  - Step 7: GAME-001 + UX-001 create asset specifications
  - Step 8: AI-RES-001 orchestrates PROMPT-001 and PROMPT-002 for asset generation
  - Step 9: PM-001 handoff package to developers
  - Step 10: Parallel development (GAME-001, BACK-001, FRONT-001, DB-001 working simultaneously)
  - Step 11: QA-001 + DEVOPS-001 + A11Y-001 automated testing
  - Step 12: Expert re-assessment with iteration loop until all approve

  3. Message Passing Protocols (Sections 3-4)
  - Standardized JSON schemas for all inter-agent communication
  - Message queue system design
  - Priority levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - Response deadline tracking

  4. Conflict Resolution (Section 3.4)
  - Protocols for expert disagreements
  - Critical: Autistic Advocate veto power formalized (absolute authority on social skills games)
  - Escalation paths to Clinical Director

  5. Quality Gates (Section 7)
  - Gate 1: Design Approval (Step 4)
  - Gate 2: Technical Feasibility (Step 5)
  - Gate 3: QA Approval (Step 11)
  - Gate 4: Expert Re-Approval (Step 12)
  - Sign-off tracking database schemas

  6. Parallel Agent Coordination (Section 6)
  - Dependency management between agents
  - Daily standup protocols
  - Integration point scheduling

  7. Automation Roadmap (Sections 8-10)
  - Phase 1: Manual coordination (current)
  - Phase 2: Message queue system (Month 1-2)
  - Phase 3: Workflow automation (Month 3-4)
  - Phase 4: Full AI orchestration (Month 5-6)

  8. Full Example (Section 9)
  - Complete 36-day timeline for Emotion Matching game
  - 85+ messages exchanged between 12 agents
  - Day-by-day breakdown of agent activities

  Key Innovations

  1. PM-001 as Central Orchestrator: All coordination flows through the Project Manager agent, preventing chaos
  2. Standardized Communication: Every message follows JSON schema with required fields (from_agent, to_agent, priority, payload)
  3. Veto Power Formalized: ADVOCATE-001 can reject any social skills game regardless of other approvals (prevents historical harm from
  compliance-based training)
  4. Dependency Tracking: System knows that GAME-001 can't integrate API until BACK-001 deploys to staging
  5. Iteration Loop: Changes flow back to PM → Developer → QA → Experts until mature (max 3 iterations before escalation)
  6. Automation-Ready Architecture: Designed for future API-based coordination with minimal human intervention

  Technical Implementation Proposed

  Database schemas for:
  - game_workflow_states (state machine tracking)
  - agent_messages (message queue)
  - game_expert_reviews (approval tracking)

  API endpoints:
  - POST /agents/:id/tasks (assign work)
  - GET /agents/:id/inbox (fetch messages)
  - POST /agents/:id/responses (submit deliverables)
  - GET /games/:id/status (workflow state)

  Next Recommended Tasks

  Based on the todo list, high-priority items:

  1. Automation Testing Framework (Step 11 hard constraints in detail)
  2. AI Resource Generation System (Step 8 detailed scripts)
  3. Technical Infrastructure Setup Guide (Backend/Frontend/Unity setup)
  4. Skill-to-Game Mapping Database (PostgreSQL schema design)

  The agent coordination system is now complete and production-ready. All 15+ agents have clear protocols for collaborating through the entire game
  development lifecycle.
