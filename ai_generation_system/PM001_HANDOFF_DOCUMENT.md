## PM-001 Responsibilities

As Project Manager, you will coordinate the following workflow steps:

### Step 8: AI Resource Generation (Your Primary Role)

**Lead Agents to Coordinate**:
- **FLUX-001**: Image generation expert (2D assets)
- **VOICE-001**: Bark voice synthesis expert (voice-overs)
- **AUDIO-001**: Stable Audio expert (SFX/music - not yet implemented)
- **COMFY-001**: ComfyUI workflow expert (advanced image gen)
- **CUBE3D-001**: Text-to-3D expert (3D models - not yet implemented)

**Your Tasks**:
1. Receive game design specifications from GAME-001 or GODOT-001
2. Extract asset requirements and create CSV specifications
3. Assign generation tasks to appropriate AI agents (FLUX-001, VOICE-001)
4. Monitor generation progress and quality
5. Validate assets meet specifications
6. Hand off completed assets to game development team

### Workflow Integration

**You interact with**:
- **GAME-001/GODOT-001** (Step 3): Receive GDDs, understand asset needs
- **QA-001** (Step 9): Coordinate quality validation
- **DEVOPS-001** (Step 11): Ensure assets deployed correctly

**Quality Gates**:
- All assets must pass automated validation (validate_assets.py)
- Manual review by you for 10% sample
- Sign-off required before handing to game dev team

## Standard Workflow

### Phase 1: Asset Specification (Your Responsibility)

**Input**: Game Design Document (GDD) from GAME-001/GODOT-001

**Your Actions**:
1. Read GDD Section 7: "Content Specifications" or "Visual Assets Required"
2. Extract all required assets:
   - Images (objects, characters, backgrounds, UI)
   - Audio (voice-overs, SFX, music)
3. Create CSV specification file

**CSV Template**:
```csv
asset_id,type,filename,description,width,height,style,text,voice
OBJ-001,image,apple_red.png,Red apple bright shiny with green leaf,512,512,educational,,
VO-001,audio,vo_intro.wav,,,,,Welcome to Color Matching!,v2/en_speaker_6
```

**Example**: See `game01_complete_spec.csv` and `game02_emotion_recognition_spec.csv`

### Phase 2: Task Assignment

**Assign to FLUX-001** (Images):
- All assets where `type="image"`
- Provide CSV with image specifications
- Expected turnaround: ~30 seconds per 512√ó512 image

**Assign to VOICE-001** (Audio):
- All assets where `type="audio"`
- Provide CSV with voice specifications
- Expected turnaround: ~25 seconds per 5-10 word clip

**Command to Execute**:
```bash
source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate
python ~/ai-tools/production_pipeline.py <game_csv> --output outputs/<game_name>
```

### Phase 3: Monitor Progress

**Real-time monitoring**:
```bash
# Watch generation progress
tail -f outputs/<game_name>/generation.log

# Check GPU utilization
nvidia-smi
```

**Expected output**:
```
Images: 75%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñå  | 15/20 [08:12<02:45, 33.1s/it]
Audio:  40%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà      | 2/5 [00:48<01:12, 24.2s/it]
```

### Phase 4: Quality Validation

**Run automated validation**:
```bash
python ~/ai-tools/validate_assets.py outputs/<game_name>/
```

**Review results**:
- ‚úÖ All valid: Approve and hand off to dev team
- ‚ùå Some invalid: Identify issues, regenerate failed assets

**Manual QA** (10% sample):
1. Open 10% of images randomly
2. Verify they match CSV descriptions
3. Check colors, clarity, style consistency
4. Listen to 10% of audio clips
5. Verify voice quality, pacing, clarity

### Phase 5: Handoff to Development

**Deliverables**:
- `outputs/<game_name>/images/` - All images organized
- `outputs/<game_name>/audio/` - All audio organized
- `outputs/<game_name>/asset_manifest.json` - Complete log
- `outputs/<game_name>/validation_report.json` - QA results

**Notify**:
- GAME-001 (Unity dev): Assets ready for import
- GODOT-001 (Godot dev): Assets ready for import
- QA-001: Ready for integration testing

|------------|----------------|--------|------------|
| Image (512√ó512) | 28-30s | ~120 | ~960 |
| Image (1024√ó1024) | 45-55s | ~70 | ~560 |
| Image (1920√ó1080) | 60-70s | ~55 | ~440 |
| Audio (5-10 words) | 20-25s | ~140 | ~1,120 |
| Audio (15-20 words) | 25-30s | ~110 | ~880 |

### Project Timeline Estimates

**Per Game** (average):

- Asset generation: 4-8 hours (automated, can run overnight)
- Quality validation: 1-2 hours
- **Total per game**: 1-2 days

**All 10 Games**:
- Sequential: 10-20 days
- With overnight runs: 5-7 days (recommended)

### Quality Metrics

**Game 01 Results**:

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: CUDA Out of Memory

**Symptoms**: Error during generation, GPU memory full

**Solution**:
```bash
# Pipeline has built-in memory optimizations
# If still failing:
# 1. Close other GPU applications
# 2. Reduce batch size (split CSV)
# 3. Restart pipeline (automatic resume)
```

**Escalate to**: DEVOPS-001 if persistent

### Issue: Poor Quality Assets

**Symptoms**: Blurry images, wrong colors, robotic voice

**Solution**:
1. Review CSV prompt quality
2. Improve descriptions (be specific)
3. Regenerate failed assets with better prompts

**Example fixes**:
- ‚ùå "a car" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Red toy car bright color simple design side view"
- ‚ùå "happy face" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Happy child age 5 big smile joyful expression"

**Escalate to**: FLUX-001 or VOICE-001 for expert prompt engineering

### Issue: Pipeline Interrupted

**Symptoms**: Generation stopped mid-process

**Solution**:
```bash
# Resume automatically (skips completed assets)
python production_pipeline.py <game_csv> --output outputs/<game_name>
```

**Check**: `asset_manifest.json` for partial completion status

### Issue: Validation Failures

**Symptoms**: validate_assets.py reports errors

**Common issues**:
- Image dimensions incorrect ‚Üí Fix CSV, regenerate
- Audio too short/long ‚Üí Adjust text length, regenerate
- File corruption ‚Üí Delete and regenerate

**Escalate to**: QA-001 for systematic validation issues
