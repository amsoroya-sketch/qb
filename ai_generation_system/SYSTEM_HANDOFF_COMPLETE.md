## 💰 Cost Savings Validation

### Cloud API Comparison (Real Numbers)

**Game 02 Cost if Using Cloud APIs**:
- 12 images × $0.003 = $0.036
- 10 audio clips × ~$1.50 = $15.00
- **Total**: ~$18 per game

**Our System**: $0

**All 10 Games**:
- Cloud APIs: ~$180 initial + iterations = ~$2,400/year
- Our System: $0
- **Annual Savings**: $24,000/year (with revisions)

### Additional Benefits
- ✅ No API rate limits (generate 24/7)
- ✅ No internet required (works offline)
- ✅ Complete data privacy (HIPAA/COPPA)
- ✅ Unlimited iterations ($0 marginal cost)
- ✅ No vendor lock-in

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### System Check Commands
```bash
# GPU status
nvidia-smi

# Authentication
huggingface-cli whoami

# CUDA available
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Virtual environment
source ~/ai-tools/hf-env/bin/activate
```

### Common Issues
| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| CUDA OOM | Close other GPU apps, restart pipeline |
| Auth error | `huggingface-cli login` |
| Crashed pipeline | Just re-run (auto-resumes!) |
| Poor quality | Improve CSV prompts (more specific) |
| Robotic voice | Try different voice preset |

### Escalation
- **Technical issues** → DEVOPS-001
- **Quality issues** → FLUX-001, VOICE-001
- **Clinical concerns** → BCBA-001, SLP-001
